        <pre><big><B>TIPS :</B> <b>Wear a long shirt </b>, This is one of the easiest ways to add color and style to your look while still being <br>  comfortable in your office setting. A long shirt is also an excellent choice when trying out new items like tunic shirts <br> or cardigans because they're easygoing enough for everyday use but still make an impression when worn with suits or more <br> formal outfits over pants/jeans/leggings ! <BR>

        <pre><big><B>TIPS :</B> <b>Wear a suit ,</b>You can wear a suit to work, but it's important that you don't overdo it. If you're<br> going to wear a suit, make sure that it fits snugly and isn't too high-waisted or wide at the hips. This will help <br>ensure that your outfit looks great even if there are other people in it!

        <pre><big><B>TIPS :</B> <b>Wear a kurti ,</b>Your office wear must be something that reflects your confidence and a formal <br> approach. When you're planning to wear kurtis to the workplace, it's best to avoid garish ones. Stick to the designs that  are<br> simple but feature clean cuts. Your Kurti should not flaunt every curve of your body and it shouldn't also be loose-fitted to hide your best features. It is best to choose a semi-fitted Kurti style for your office. You can raise your <br>style bar by selecting Kurtis with collar, long cotton jacket and boat neck for your workplace.
